This is a collection of IETF & IANA MIBs pre-compiled and packaged to
simplify their use with older versions of [PySNMP library](http://pysnmp.sf.net).

WARNING: since version 4.3, PySNMP performs MIB parsing automatically by calling
[pysmi](http://pysmi.sf.net) library. You may still need `pysnmp-mibs` package if
you are running older version of PySNMP.

MIB modules shipped in pysnmp-mibs package were taken from
[http://mibs.snmplabs.com/asn1/](http://mibs.snmplabs.com/asn1/) and compiled
into pysnmp format with pysmi's
[mibdump.py](https://github.com/etingof/pysmi/blob/master/scripts/mibdump.py)
tool.

Why this fork?
--------------
[Original project](https://github.com/etingof/pysnmp-mibs) by [Ilya Etingof](https://github.com/etingof) seems not to be continued anymore.
Because of that, we try to maintain / enhance Pre-compiled PySNMP MIBs.

Installation
------------

Download pysnmp-mibs from [PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysnmp-mibs) or just run:
